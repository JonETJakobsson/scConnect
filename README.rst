=========

The end goal of scConnect is to provide information about putative interaction between cell populations 
in single cell RNA-seq data. 
To do so gene expression levels are used to asses precence or absence of ligands and receptors. 
This information is then integrated with ligand receptor interaction data from `Guide to pharmacology`__ 
to detect putative connections.
The resulting NetworkX graph can be analysed and browsed using a dash web app.
