scConnect integrate gene expression profiles in scRNA-seq datasets with ligand and receptor interaction information from `Guide to pharmacology <https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/>`__ to construct a graph containing all putative interaction between cell types in the dataset. scConnect integrate well with Scanpy and  can be appended to  any scanpy analysis pipeline.

=========
Usecases:
=========

* Identify putative cell-cell communication in a tissue
* Infer neuronal networks based on ligand receptor compatability
* Study connectivity changes following treatment
